Hi Sarah,

Thank you for joining the Spring Forward 2026 campaign kickoff meeting today. 
Great energy in the room and I'm excited to have you leading the creative direction.

Quick recap of your action items from our discussion:

1. FINALIZE CAMPAIGN CREATIVE BRIEF
   Due: January 22, 2026 (next Wednesday)
   This is critical for our Studio Bloom kickoff, so please prioritize.

2. SCHEDULE KICKOFF CALL WITH STUDIO BLOOM  
   Due: End of day tomorrow (January 16)
   Getting this scheduled quickly will help us maintain our timeline.

3. PREPARE BUDGET BREAKDOWN SPREADSHEET
   Due: Friday, January 17
   We need the $50K breakdown documented for tracking purposes.

Remember, March 1st is our firm launch date, so these early deadlines are 
essential for keeping everything on track.

Let me know if you need any support or have questions about the creative direction.

Best regards,

SUBJECT: Spring Forward 2026 — Your Action Items from Today's Kickoff
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Mike,

Thanks for flagging the tracking setup time concern during our kickoff — glad 
we could resolve that and get you starting immediately. Your analytics expertise 
is going to be crucial for measuring this campaign's success.

Here are your three action items from today's meeting:

1. UTM PARAMETER STRATEGY DOCUMENT
   Due: January 20, 2026
   We need this before the January 20 review meeting.

2. COMPETITOR CAMPAIGN REVIEW
   Due: January 21, 2026 (Tuesday presentation)
   Insights from competitor analysis will inform our creative approach.

3. GOOGLE ANALYTICS TRACKING INFRASTRUCTURE
   Due: January 24, 2026
   This is foundational for everything else, so thank you for starting early.

The UTM strategy review is scheduled for January 20 — please come prepared 
to present your document then.

If you hit any technical blockers with the GA setup, don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

TO: Priya Patel <priya.patel@company.com>
SUBJECT: Spring Forward Campaign — Your Action Items & Mailchimp Access
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Priya,

Great to have you on board for the Spring Forward 2026 campaign. Your email
marketing expertise will be key to hitting our 100K impressions target.

Here are your action items from today's kickoff:

1. DRAFT EMAIL SEQUENCE (3 EMAILS)
   Due: January 23, 2026
   We'll need these ready for review well before the March 1 launch.

2. LEGAL COMPLIANCE COORDINATION
   Due: January 27, 2026
   Please submit early — this is a potential risk area for delays.

3. PHOTOGRAPHY SESSION BOOKING
   Due: February 5, 2026
   Book the session for our product shots.

QUICK NOTE: Alex is setting up your Mailchimp access by tomorrow (Jan 16),
so you'll have what you need to start drafting the email sequence.

Also — we're considering two hashtag options: #SpringForward2026 or just #Grow.
Would love your take on which might resonate better with our email audience.

Looking forward to working with you on this campaign!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

TO: Alex Thompson <alex.thompson@company.com>
SUBJECT: Spring Forward 2026 — Technical Action Items & Launch Prep
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Alex,

Thanks for taking ownership of the technical infrastructure for Spring Forward
2026. The landing page and A/B testing setup are going to be critical for
converting those 100K impressions.

Your action items from today's meeting:

1. SET UP MAILCHIMP ACCOUNT FOR PRIYA
   Due: End of day tomorrow (January 16)
   This is a blocker for Priya's email drafting, so appreciate the quick turnaround.

2. IMPLEMENT A/B TESTING FRAMEWORK
   Due: February 1, 2026
   We need this live for at least a month before March 1 launch.

3. UPDATE WEBSITE LANDING PAGE
   Due: February 15, 2026
   Final landing page with all campaign assets integrated.

4. PREPARE LAUNCH DAY MONITORING SCHEDULE
   Due: February 28, 2026 (before launch)
   We'll need a clear protocol for March 1st.

The March 1st launch date is firm — everyone agreed today. Your work in
February is going to set us up for success.

Let me know if you need any creative assets early for testing purposes.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
