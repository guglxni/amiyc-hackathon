# Cline Rules for AMIYC Hackathon Projects

## Project Context
- This is part of the "Automate Me If You Can" Hackathon (Feb 16-22, 2026)
- Using multi-agent workflows with Cline CLI and Kimi Code CLI
- Building Accomplish.ai automation skills

## Coding Standards (from acquired skills)

### Python Best Practices
- Use `d[key]` for required dictionary keys (fail fast)
- No mutable defaults in function parameters
- Validate inputs early before expensive operations
- Use specific exceptions with context (ValueError, TypeError, not generic Exception)
- Chain exceptions with `raise ... from e` to preserve debug info
- Handle partial failures in batch operations
- Use Pydantic for complex validation
- Place all imports at top of file (no inline imports)
- Avoid explanatory comments for self-documenting code
- Remove unnecessary else blocks after return/break/continue

### Error Handling
- Fail fast: validate at API boundaries
- Include context in error messages (what, why, how to fix)
- Use Python's built-in exception types appropriately
- Create custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
- Never let one bad item abort entire batch operations

### Code Organization
- Clean code principles (SOLID)
- Single responsibility for functions/classes
- Descriptive naming (no abbreviations)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Remove duplication, simplify modules

## Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns

### When Using Cline
- Use `-m act` for trusted, repetitive tasks
- Use `-m plan` for new features or risky operations
- Use `-y` (yolo) mode only after verification
- Use `--timeout 300` for longer operations
- Attach context files with `-f`

### When Using Kimi
- Use `--print` for non-interactive documentation generation
- Use `--session` to maintain context across commands
- Use `--continue` to resume previous work
- Use `--yolo` for automated workflows

## Safety Rules
**CRITICAL: No commits, pushes, or external actions without user consultation**
- Stage changes but do not commit
- Show diff before any git operation
- Ask for explicit approval before: commits, pushes, PRs, branch creation

## Documentation
- Create README.md for every skill
- Include usage examples
- Document error handling
- Add comments only when necessary (prefer self-documenting code)
