| **Starting too complex** | Won't finish in time | Start simple, add features |
| **No clear problem statement** | Judges don't understand value | Define problem in 1 sentence |
| **Skipping the "boring way" demo** | No contrast | Show manual → automated |
| **Ignoring judging criteria** | Lose 40% of score | Match every criterion |
| **Waiting until last minute** | Rushed, lower quality | Start day 1! |
| **Not testing on video** | Demo fails live | Test your recording setup |
